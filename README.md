# Datadog Java Profiling Agent/Library
This repo contains the Datadog Profiling agent. It can either be used to embed with another Java Agent, for example the APM Java Agent, or as a stand along JPLIS agent. 

The library provides functionality to create and dump flight recordings, and to upload the recordings with the appropriate metadata to an http based edge service.
